##jChartFX Libraries##


The jChartFX libraries have been split into several .js files to provide 
granular control over what you add as a reference in your html thus allowing 
you to limit what the browser downloads when the page is accessed.

The only two files required in any scenario are:

- *jchartfx.coreVector.js* or *jchartfx.coreBasic.js* (depending on whether you want to use Vector based rendering or not) 
- *jchartfx.system.js* 
	

Beyond those two, you can add or remove references as needed based on the 
functionality you want to make available on the chart.

Below you will find a complete list of libraries and their description
to help you decide whether to reference them or not.
